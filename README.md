# Recursion Checkpoint


This algorithm determines whether a given word is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends of the word simultaneously.

It uses counters and loops to efficiently iterate through the word, checking for any differences between characters. 

If no differences are found, the algorithm concludes that the word is a palindrome; otherwise, it determines that the word is not a palindrome.
